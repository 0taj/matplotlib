Selectors improvement
---------------------

The `~matplotlib.widgets.RectangleSelector` and
`~matplotlib.widgets.EllipseSelector` can now be rotated interactively. The rotation is
enabled and disabled by pressing the 'r' key.
The "square" shape can be defined in data or display coordinate system as defined
by the *data_coordinates* modifier.
