New `~.axes.Axes.axline` method
-------------------------------

A new `~.axes.Axes.axline` method has been added to draw infinitely long lines
that pass through two points.



.. plot::
   :include-source: True

   fig, ax = plt.subplots()

   ax.axline((.1, .1), slope=5, color='C0', label='by slope')
   ax.axline((.1, .2), (.8, .7), color='C3', label='by points')

   ax.legend()
