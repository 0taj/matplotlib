Matplotlib Mission Statement
============================

The mission of the Matplotlib developer community is to develop, maintain, and
support Matplotlib and its extensions which provide plotting tools for users of
the Scientific Python Ecosystem.  We success is based on how effectively we
enable our users, across scientific, industrial, commercial, and educational
applications, to achieve their goals.  A diverse developer community creates
the best software and we welcome anyone, regardless of experience, education,
gender, or nationality, who shares our mission to the community.


Adapting the requirements :ref:`laid out by John Hunter
<History>` Matplotlib should:

* Support all users of the Scientific Python Ecosystem;
* Produce high-quality raster and vector formats output;
* Be embeddedable in graphical user interfaces for application development;
* Be understandable and extendable by scientists, data scientists, and
  engineers;
* Make standard plots easy;
* Make novel or complicated visualizations possible.

To achieve these goals simultaneously across the full gamut of the domains we
support we have adopted a model of a core general library and an ecosystem of
domain-specific extensions that inter-operate as much as practical.
