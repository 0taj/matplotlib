Matplotlib Mission Statement
============================

The Matplotlib developer community develops, maintains, and supports Matplotlib
and its extensions to provide plotting tools for the Scientific Python
Ecosystem.  Our success is based on how effectively we enable our users, across
scientific, industrial, commercial, and educational domains, to achieve their
goals.

We believe that a diverse developer community creates the best software, and we
welcome anyone who shares our mission and values, as described in the code of
conduct.


Adapting the requirements :ref:`laid out by John Hunter
<History>` Matplotlib should:

* Support all users of the Scientific Python Ecosystem;
* Produce high-quality raster and vector formats output;
* Be embeddedable in graphical user interfaces for application development,
  standalone, and on the web.
* Be understandable and extendable by people familiar with data processing
  techniques and with the Python programming language;
* Make common plots easy;
* Make novel or complicated visualizations possible.

To achieve these goals for the full range of domains where Scientific Python is
used, Matplotlib provides a general library on which domain-specific
extensions can be built.
