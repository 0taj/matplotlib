Matplotlib Mission Statement
============================

The Matplotlib developer community develops, maintains, and
supports Matplotlib and its extensions, providing plotting tools for 
the Scientific Python Ecosystem.  Our success is based on how effectively we
enable our users, across scientific, industrial, commercial, and educational
applications, to achieve their goals.  We believe that a diverse developer community creates
the best software, and we welcome anyone, regardless of experience, education,
gender, or nationality, who shares our mission to the community.


Adapting the requirements :ref:`laid out by John Hunter
<History>` Matplotlib should:

* Support all users of the Scientific Python Ecosystem;
* Produce high-quality raster and vector formats output;
* Be embeddedable in graphical user interfaces for application development;
* Be understandable and extendable by scientists, data scientists, and
  engineers;
* Make standard plots easy;
* Make novel or complicated visualizations possible.

To achieve these goals simultaneously across the full gamut of the domains that depend on Matplotlib, 
we have adopted a model of a general core library that supports an ecosystem of
domain-specific extensions that inter-operate as much as practical.
