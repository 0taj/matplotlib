``matplotlib.axes.Axes.indicate_inset`` returns a 4-tuple as documented
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

In <= 3.1.0, ``matplotlib.axes.Axes.indicate_inset`` and
``matplotlib.axes.Axes.indicate_inset_zoom`` were documented as returning
a 4-tuple of ``matplotlib.patches.ConnectionPatch`` es, where in fact they
returned a 4-length list.

They now correctly return a 4-tuple.
``matplotlib.axes.Axes.indicate_inset`` would previously raise an error if
the optional *inset_ax* was not supplied; it now completes successfully,
and returns *None* instead of the tuple of ``ConnectionPatch`` es.
