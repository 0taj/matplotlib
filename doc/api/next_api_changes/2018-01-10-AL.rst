Changes in parameter names
``````````````````````````

- The ``arg`` parameter to `matplotlib.use` has been renamed to ``backend``.
- The ``normed`` parameter to `Axes.hist2d` has been renamed to ``density``.
- The ``s`` parameter to `Annotation` (and indirectly `Axes.annotation`) has
  been renamed to ``text``.

In each case, the old parameter name remains supported (it cannot be used
simultaneously with the new name), but suppport for it will be dropped in
Matplotlib 3.3.
