Passing scalars to parameter where in ``fill_between()`` and ``fill_betweenx()``
````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

Passing scalars to parameter *where* in ``fill_between()`` and
``fill_betweenx()`` is deprecated. While the documentation already states that
*where* must be of the same size as *x* (or *y*), scalars were accepted and
broadcasted to the size of *x*. Non-matching sizes will raise a ``ValueError``
in the future.
