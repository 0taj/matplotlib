Deprecations
````````````

The following methods and attributes of the `MovieWriterRegistry` class are
deprecated: ``set_dirty``, ``ensure_not_dirty``, ``reset_available_writers``,
``avail``.

The ``rcsetup.validate_animation_writer_path`` function is deprecated.

`MovieWriterRegistry` now always checks the availability of the writer classes
before returning them.  If one wishes, for example, to get the first available
writer, without performing the availability check on subsequent writers, it is
now possible to iterate over the registry, which will yield the names of the
available classes.
