``Axes.label_outer``, ``Axes.is_last_row``, and ``Axes.is_last_col`` now work correctly for axes spanning multiple rows or columns
``````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````````

``Axes.label_outer`` now correctly keep the x labels and tick labels visible
for Axes spanning multiple rows, as long as they cover the last row of the Axes
grid.  (This is consistent with keeping the y labels and tick labels visible
for Axes spanning multiple columns as long as they cover the first column of
the Axes grid.)

The ``Axes.is_last_row`` and ``Axes.is_last_col`` methods now correctly return
True for Axes spanning multiple rows, as long as they cover the last row or
column respectively.  Again this is consistent with the behavior for axes
covering the first row or column.

The ``Axes.rowNum`` and ``Axes.colNum`` attributes are deprecated, as they only
refer to the first grid cell covered by the Axes.  Instead, use the new
``ax.get_subplotspec().rowspan`` and ``ax.get_subplotspec().colspan``
properties, which are `range` objects indicating the whole span of rows and
columns covered by the subplot.

(Note that all methods and attributes mentioned here actually only exist on
the ``Subplot`` subclass of `Axes`, which is used for grid-positioned Axes but
not for Axes positioned directly in absolute coordinates.)

The `.GridSpec` class gained the ``nrows`` and ``ncols`` properties as more
explicit synonyms for the parameters returned by ``GridSpec.get_geometry``.
