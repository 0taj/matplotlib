``FigureCanvasBase`` now always has a ``manager`` attribute, which may be None

Previously, it did not necessarily have such an attribute.  A check for
``hasattr(figure.canvas, "manager")`` should now be replaced by
``figure.canvas.manager is not None`` (or ``getattr(figure.canvas, "manager", None) is not None``
for back-compatibility).
