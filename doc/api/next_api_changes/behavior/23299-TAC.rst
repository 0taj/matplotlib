mpl.rc_context no longer resests the `'backend'` key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you want to rest :rc:`backend` after the context, you must use
`matplotlib.use` to change the backend.  Previously the key would be reset, but
it would have any of the expected side-effects because internally
`matplotlib.rc_context` side-steps the custom logic in the
`~matplotlib.RcParams` class (because we copied the values from ``rcParamms``
so it does not need to be re-validated.
