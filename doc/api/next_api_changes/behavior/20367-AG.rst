``Text``
~~~~~~~~

``Text`` objects now allow a **parse_math** keyword-only argument
which defaults to True. When it is passed as False, that text object
will consider the string as a literal and will not try to parse it
as a mathtext object.

``TextBox``
-----------
``TextBox`` now defaults its text object's **parse_math** argument
as False.
