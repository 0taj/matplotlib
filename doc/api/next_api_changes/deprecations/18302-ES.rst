3D properties on renderers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The properties of the 3D Axes that were placed on the Renderer during draw are
now deprecated:

* ``renderer.M``
* ``renderer.eye``
* ``renderer.vvec``
* ``renderer.get_axis_position``

These attributes are all available via `.Axes3D`, which can be accessed via
``self.axes`` on all `.Artist`\s.
