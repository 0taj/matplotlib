Pending deprecation top-level cmap registration and access functions in ``mpl.cm``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As part of a `multi-step process
<https://github.com/matplotlib/matplotlib/issues/20853>`_ we are refactoring
the global state for managing the registered colormaps.

In Matplotlib 3.5 we added a `.ColormapRegistry` class and exposed an
instance at the top level as ``matplotlib.colormaps``.  The existing
top level functions in `matplotlib.cm` (``get_cmap``, ``register_cmap``,
``unregister_cmap``) were changed to be aliases around the same instance.

In Matplotlib 3.6 we have marked those top level functions as pending
deprecation with the intention of deprecation in Matplotlib 3.7.  The
following functions have been marked for pending deprecation:

- `matplotlib.cm.get_cmap`
- `matplotlib.cm.register_cmap`
- `matplotlib.cm.unregister_cmap`
- ``matplotlib.pyplot.register_cmap``

The ``matplotlib.pyplot.get_cmap`` function is intentionally exempted from this
deprecation process.
