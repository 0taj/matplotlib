NavigationToolbar2._init_toolbar
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overriding this method to initialize third-party toolbars is no longer
supported. Instead, the toolbar should be initialized in the ``__init__``
method of the subclass (which should call the base-class' ``__init__`` as
appropriate).

NavigationToolbar2.press and .release
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These methods were called when pressing or releasing a mouse button, but *only*
when an interactive pan or zoom was occurring (contrary to what the docs
stated). They are no longer called; if you write a backend which needs to
customize such events, please directly override
``press_pan``/``press_zoom``/``release_pan``/``release_zoom`` instead.

NavigationToolbar2QT.parent and .basedir
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
These attributes have been removed. In order to access the parent window, use
``toolbar.canvas.parent()`` or ``toolbar.parent()``. The base directory to the
icons is ``os.path.join(mpl.get_data_path(), "images")``.

NavigationToolbar2QT.ctx
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This attribute has been removed.

NavigationToolbar2Wx attributes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The ``prevZoomRect``, ``retinaFix``, ``savedRetinaImage``, ``wxoverlay``,
``zoomAxes``, ``zoomStartX``, and ``zoomStartY`` attributes have been removed.
