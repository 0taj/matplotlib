``matplotlib.mlab``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
``mlab.apply_window`` and ``mlab.stride_repeat`` have been removed.

axisartist
~~~~~~~~~~
``mpl_toolkits.axisartist.grid_finder.GridFinderBase`` has been removed; use
`.GridFinder` instead.

``axisartist.axis_artist.BezierPath`` has been removed; use
`.patches.PathPatch` instead.

Returning a factor equal to None from axisartist Locators (which are **not**
the same as "standard" tick Locators), or passing a factor equal to None
to axisartist Formatters (which are **not** the same as "standard" tick
Formatters) is no longer supported. Pass a factor equal to 1 instead.
