*ismath* parameter of ``draw_tex``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The *ismath* parameter of the ``draw_tex`` method of all renderer classes has
been removed (as a call to ``draw_tex`` -- not to be confused with
``draw_text``! -- means that the entire string should be passed to the
``usetex`` machinery anyways). Likewise, the text machinery will no longer pass
the *ismath* parameter when calling ``draw_tex`` (this should only matter for
backend implementers).

Passing ``ismath="TeX!"`` to `.RendererAgg.get_text_width_height_descent` is no
longer supported; pass ``ismath="TeX"`` instead,
