Maximum line length increased to 88 characters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The maximum line length for new contributions has been extended from 79 characters to
88 characters.
This change provides an extra 9 characters to allow code which is a single idea to fit
on fewer lines (often a single line).
Other line lengths considered included 115 and 99, but ultimately 88 characters was the
consensus as it is relatively conservative while still providing reasonable benefit.
The ability to view side-by-side git diffs was a key point in choosing the smaller
limit.
Additionally, it is easier to increase the line length again than to decrease it if it
was found too large.
The chosen length is the same as `black <https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/the_black_code_style/current_style.html#line-length>`_.
Their justifications influenced the discussion and provided a standard value.
