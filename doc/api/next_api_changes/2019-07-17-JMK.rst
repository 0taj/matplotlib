Default interpolation for `image` is new "antialiased" option
-------------------------------------------------------------

Images displayed in Matplotlib previously used nearest-neighbor
interpolation, leading to aliasing effects for downscaling and non-integer
upscaling.  

New default for :rc:`image.interpolation` is the new option "antialiased".
`imshow(A, interpolation='antialiased')` will apply a Hanning filter when
resampling the data in A for display (or saving to file) *if* the upsample
rate is less than a factor of three, and not an integer; downsampled data is
always smoothed at resampling.

To get the old behavior, set :rc:`interpolation` to the old default "nearest"
(or specify the ``interpolation`` kwarg of `.Axes.imshow`)

To always get the anti-aliasing behavior, no matter what the up/down sample
rate, set :rc:`interpolation` to "hanning" (or one of the other filters
available.

Note that the "hanning" filter was chosen because it has only a modest
performance penalty.  Anti-aliasing can be improved with other filters.
