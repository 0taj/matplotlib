`.Formatter.fix_minus` now performs hyphen-to-unicode-minus replacement
whenever :rc:`axes.unicode_minus` is True; i.e. its behavior matches the one
of ``.ScalarFormatter.fix_minus`` (`.ScalarFormatter` now just inherits that
implementation).

This replacement is now used by the ``format_data_short`` method of the various
builtin formatter classes, which affects the cursor value in the GUI toolbars.
